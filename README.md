# Age-Gender-Detection-from-Image
I have taken a dataset of images and detected the person's age and gender by modeling the problem as a CNN. 

Detecting age is a regression problem. I have used reLU as the activation function and mean absolute error as the loss function. 

Detecting gender is a classification problem. I have used Sigmoid as the activation function and Binary cross-entropy as the loss function. 

Tensorflow and OpenCV libraries are used for implementation.
